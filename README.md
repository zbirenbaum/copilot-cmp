# copilot-cmp

This repository transforms https://github.com/zbirenbaum/copilot.lua into a cmp source.

Copilot suggestions will automatically be loaded into your cmp menu as snippets and display their full contents when a copilot suggestion is hovered.

## Setup

If you already have copilot.lua installed, you can install this plugin with packer as you would any other with the following code:

### Install

#### Lazy
```lua
{
  "zbirenbaum/copilot-cmp",
  config = function ()
    require("copilot_cmp").setup()
  end
}

```

#### Packer
```lua
use {
  "zbirenbaum/copilot-cmp",
  after = { "copilot.lua" },
  config = function ()
    require("copilot_cmp").setup()
  end
}
```

If you do not have copilot.lua installed, go to https://github.com/zbirenbaum/copilot.lua and follow the instructions there before installing this one

It is recommended to disable copilot.lua's suggestion and panel modules, as they can interfere with completions properly appearing in copilot-cmp. To do so, simply place the following in your copilot.lua config:
```lua
require("copilot").setup({
  suggestion = { enabled = false },
  panel = { enabled = false },
})
```

### Configuration:

#### nvim-cmp:

##### Source Definition

To link cmp with this source, simply go into your cmp configuration file and include `{ name = "copilot" }` under your sources

Here is an example of what it should look like:

```lua
cmp.setup {
  ...
  sources = {
    -- Copilot Source
    { name = "copilot", group_index = 2 },
    -- Other Sources
    { name = "nvim_lsp", group_index = 2 },
    { name = "path", group_index = 2 },
    { name = "luasnip", group_index = 2 },
  },
  ...
}
```

##### Highlighting & Icon

Copilot's cmp source now has a builtin highlight group `CmpItemKindCopilot`. To add an icon to copilot for lspkind, simply add copilot to your lspkind symbol map.

```lua
-- lspkind.lua
local lspkind = require("lspkind")
lspkind.init({
  symbol_map = {
    Copilot = "",
  },
})

vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "CmpItemKindCopilot", {fg ="#6CC644"})
```

Alternatively, you can add Copilot to the lspkind `symbol_map` within the cmp format function.

```lua
-- cmp.lua
cmp.setup {
  ...
  formatting = {
    format = lspkind.cmp_format({
      mode = "symbol",
      max_width = 50,
      symbol_map = { Copilot = "" }
    })
  }
  ...
}
```

If you do not use lspkind, simply add the custom icon however you normally handle `kind` formatting and it will integrate as if it was any other normal lsp completion kind.

##### Tab Completion Configuration (Highly Recommended)
Unlike other completion sources, copilot can use other lines above or below an empty line to provide a completion. This can be problematic for individuals that select menu entries with `<TAB>`. This behavior is configurable via cmp's config and the following code will make it so that the menu still appears normally, but tab will fallback to indenting unless a non-whitespace character has actually been typed.

```lua
local has_words_before = function()
  if vim.api.nvim_buf_get_option(0, "buftype") == "prompt" then return false end
  local line, col = unpack(vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0))
  return col ~= 0 and vim.api.nvim_buf_get_text(0, line-1, 0, line-1, col, {})[1]:match("^%s*$") == nil
end
cmp.setup({
  mapping = {
    ["<Tab>"] = vim.schedule_wrap(function(fallback)
      if cmp.visible() and has_words_before() then
        cmp.select_next_item({ behavior = cmp.SelectBehavior.Select })
      else
        fallback()
      end
    end),
  },
})
```

##### Comparators

One custom comparitor for sorting cmp entries is provided: `prioritize`. The `prioritize` comparitor causes copilot entries to appear higher in the cmp menu. It is recommended keeping priority weight at 2, or placing the `exact` comparitor above copilot so that better lsp matches are not stuck below poor copilot matches.

Example:

```lua
cmp.setup {
  ...
  sorting = {
    priority_weight = 2,
    comparators = {
      require("copilot_cmp.comparators").prioritize,

      -- Below is the default comparitor list and order for nvim-cmp
      cmp.config.compare.offset,
      -- cmp.config.compare.scopes, --this is commented in nvim-cmp too
      cmp.config.compare.exact,
      cmp.config.compare.score,
      cmp.config.compare.recently_used,
      cmp.config.compare.locality,
      cmp.config.compare.kind,
      cmp.config.compare.sort_text,
      cmp.config.compare.length,
      cmp.config.compare.order,
    },
  },
  ...
}
```

#### copilot-cmp:
Note: It is now **heavily** discouraged to modify the default settings unless an issue gives you good reason to do so.

The configurable options for this plugin are as follows:
```lua
{
  event = { "InsertEnter", "LspAttach" },
  fix_pairs = true,
}
```
##### event
The event parameter configures when the source is registered. Unless you have a unique problem for your particular configuration you probably don't want to touch this.

##### fix_pairs
Suppose you have the following code:
`print('h')`
Copilot might try to account for the `'` and `)` and complete it with this:
`print('hello`

This is not good behavior for consistency reasons and will just end up deleting the two ending characters. This option fixes that. Don't turn this off unless you are having problems with pairs and believe this might be causing them.
